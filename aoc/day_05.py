# Part 01

- Given a list of boarding passes like `FBFBBFFRLR`
- Find your seat inside a plane
- The plane is divided into rows and columns
- The boarding pass is a binary space partition

- The first 7 characters define the rows
- Starting with [0, ..., 127]
- `F` instructs you to go to the lower half, [0, ..., 63]
- `B` instructs you to go to the upper half, [32, ..., 63]
- `F` instructs you to go to the lower half, [32, ..., 47]
- `B` instructs you to go to the upper half, [40, ..., 47]
- `B` instructs you to go to the upper half, [44, ..., 47]
- `F` instructs you to go to the lower half, [44, 45]
- `F` instructs you to go to the lower half, [44], which is the row.

- The last 3 characters will be the columns
- Starting with [0, ..., 7]
- `R` instructs you to take the upper half, [4, ..., 7]
- `L` instructs you to take the lower half, [4, 5]
- `R` instructs you to take the upper half, [5], which is the line

- Finally, we have the seat's ID
    - Given by the product of the row number by 8
    - Plus the column number
- For the given example, the ID is 44 * 8 + 5 = 357
